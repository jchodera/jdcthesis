\label{chapter:efficient-computation-of-transition-rates}

%Because of the deficiencies observed in the ability of replica-exchange simulations to reach equilibrium, even after unpractically long simulation times (cite bill trpzip2), we are forced to resort to other means to compute equilibrium transition probabilities.
%One way to compute equilibrium expectations is through uncoupling-coupling approaches...
