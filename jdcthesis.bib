	Abstract = {Abstract
Molecular dynamics simulations rely on integrating the classical (Newtonian) equations of motion for a molecular system and thus, sample a microcanonical (constant-energy) ensemble by default. However, for compatibility with experiment, it is often desirable to sample configurations from a canonical (constant-temperature) ensemble instead. A modification of the basic molecular dynamics scheme with the purpose of maintaining the temperature constant (on average) is called a thermostat algorithm. The present article reviews the various thermostat algorithms proposed to date, their physical basis, their advantages and their shortcomings.

@article{dalessandro:jpcb:2002,
	Abstract = {In this article, we investigate molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of a butane molecule, as obtained using different types of thermostats. Results show that at low temperature. where the harmonic approximation holds, the Nose'-Hoover (NH) thermostat fails to reproduce the statistical mechanical behavior, even using simulation lengths of millions of time steps, whereas the Gaussian isokinetic (IG) thermostat reproduces quite well the expected statistical mechanical values. The Berendsen's coupling (BC) provides good results for basic properties such as the average potential and kinetic energies but fails in reproducing the canonical fluctuations. Moreover, using the speed of divergence of initially nearby trajectories in phase space as a measure of the dynamical chaoticity, we found that the NH thermostat provides very slow divergence for the physical phase space degrees of freedom, concentrating most of its chaoticity in the dynamics of the thermostat virtual degree of freedom. On the contrary, the IG thermostat provides always highly diverging trajectories in phase space, characterized by a high chaoticity of each degree of freedom. Finally, the BC thermostat provides a moderate chaotic behavior for all of the degrees of freedom. Such results suggest that even assuming for both the ``rigorous'' algorithms (NH and IG) a full ergodic behavior the NH thermostat could require an extremely long time to achieve convergence of the time averaged properties.

	Abstract = {A new method for refining three-dimensional (3D) NMR structures of proteins is described, which takes 
account of the complete relaxation pathways. Derivatives of the NOE intensities with respect to the dihedral 
angles are analytically calculated, and efficiently evaluated with the use of a filter technique for identifying 
the dominant terms of these derivatives. This new method was implemented in the distance geometry pro- 
gram DIANA. As an initial test, we refined 30 rigid distorted helical structures, using a simulated data set of 
NOE distance constraints for a rigid standard or-helix. The final root-mean-square deviations of the refined 
structures relative to the standard helix were less than 0. I A, and the R-factors dropped from values between 
7% and 32% to values of less than 0.5% in all cases, which compares favorably with the results from distance 
geometry calculations. In particular, because spin diffusion was not explicitly considered in the evaluation of 
'exact' t H ~H distances corresponding to the simulated NOE intensities, a group of nearly identical distance 
geometry structures was obtained which had about 0.5/~ root-mean-square deviation from the standard ~t- 
helix. Further test calculations using an experimental NOE data set recorded for the protein trypsin inhibitor 
K showed that the complete relaxation matrix refinement procedure in the DIANA program is functional 
also with systems of practical interest.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Understanding the relationship between the amino acid sequence of a 
protein and its unique, compact 3D structure is one of the grand challenges in molecular 
biophysics. One particularly exciting approach is time-resolved electronic circular 
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which offers resolution on a nanosecond (or faster) time 
scale, although it does not provide the spatial resolution of techniques like X-ray 
crystallography or NMR. The thrust of our work is to underpin fast time scale spec- 
troscopic studies of protein folding with a stronger theoretical foundation. Ultimately, 
we seek to use molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of conformational 
dynamics and conformational transitions on the electronic CD spectra of proteins. We 
discuss how improved quantum chemical models of individual chromophores, including 
aromatic sidechains, can be incorporated into calculations of the electronic structure of 
proteins and their CD. Chirality 16:234 -- 243, 2004. },

	Abstract = {Macromolecular structures calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance data 
are not fully determined by experimental data but depend on subjective 
choices in data treatment and parameter settings. This makes it difficult to 
objectively judge the precision of the structures. We used Bayesian inference 
to derive a probability distribution that represents the unknown structure and 
its precision. This probability distribution also determines additional un- 
knowns, such as theory parameters, that previously had to be chosen empiri- 
cally. We implemented this approach by using Markov chain Monte Carlo 
techniques. Our method provides an objective figure of merit and improves 
structural quality.

	Abstract = {The recently described molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) 
method for calculating free energies is applied to a congeneric series of 16 ligands to p38 MAP 
kinase whose binding constants span approximately 2 orders of magnitude. These compounds 
have previously been used to test and compare other free energy calculation methods, including 
thermodynamic integration (TI), OWFEG, ChemScore, PLPScore, and Dock Energy Score. We 
find that the MM-PBSA performs relatively poorly for this set of ligands, yielding results much 
inferior to those from TI or OWFEG, inferior to Dock Energy Score, and not appreciably better 
than ChemScore or PLPScore but at an appreciably larger computational cost than any of 
these other methods. This suggests that one should be selective in applying the MM-PBSA 
method and that for systems that are amenable to other free energy approaches, these other 
approaches may be preferred. We also examine the single simulation approximation for MM- 
PBSA, whereby the required ligand and protein trajectories are extracted from a single MD 
simulation rather than two separate MD runs. This assumption, sometimes used to speed the 
MM-PBSA calculation, is found to yield significantly inferior results with only a moderate net 
percentage reduction in total simulation time. },

	Abstract = {Several a priori tests of a systematic stochastic mode reduction procedure recently devised by the authors [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96 (1999) 14687; Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 54 (2001) 891] are developed here. In this procedure, reduced stochastic equations for a smaller collections of resolved variables are derived systematically for complex nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom and a large collection of unresolved variables. While the above approach is mathematically rigorous in the limit when the ratio of correlation times between the resolved and the unresolved variables is arbitrary small, it is shown here on a systematic hierarchy of models that this ratio can be surprisingly big. Typically, the systematic reduced stochastic modeling yields quantitatively realistic dynamics for ratios as large as 1/2. The examples studied here vary from instructive stochastic triad models to prototype complex systems with many degrees of freedom utilizing the truncated Burgers--Hopf equations as a nonlinear heat bath. Systematic quantitative tests for the stochastic modeling procedure are developed here which involve the stationary distribution and the two-time correlations for the second and fourth moments including the resolved variables and the energy in the resolved variables. In an important illustrative example presented here, the nonlinear original system involves 102 degrees of freedom and the reduced stochastic model predicted by the theory for two resolved variables involves both nonlinear interaction and multiplicative noises. Even for large value of the correlation time ratio of the order of 1/2, the reduced stochastic model with two degrees of freedom captures the essentially nonlinear and non-Gaussian statistics of the original nonlinear systems with 102 modes extremely well. Furthermore, it is shown here that the standard regression fitting of the second-order correlations alone fails to reproduce the nonlinear stochastic dynamics in this example. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {For classical systems with anharmonic forces, Newton's equations for particle trajectories are nonlinear, while Liouville's equation for the evolution of functions of position and momentum is linear and is solved by constructing a basis of functions in which the Liouvillian is a tridiagonal matrix, which is then diagonalized. For systems that are chaotic in the sense that neighboring trajectories diverge exponentially, the initial conditions determine the solution to Liouville's equation for short times; but for long times, the solutions decay exponentially at rates independent of the initial conditions. These are the relaxation rates of irreversible processes, and they arise in these calculations as the imaginary parts of the frequencies where there are singularities in the analytic continuations of solutions to Liouville's equation. These rates are calculated for two examples: the inverted oscillator, which can be solved both analytically and numerically, and a charged particle in a periodic magnetic field, which can only be solved numerically. In these systems, dissipation arises from traveling-wave solutions to Liouville's equation that couple low and high wave-number modes allowing energy to flow from disturbances that are coherent over large scales to disturbances on ever smaller scales finally becoming incoherent over microscopic scales. These results suggest that dissipation in large scale motion of the system is a consequence of chaos in the small scale motion.  S1063-651X 99 07405-X  },

Here we show that, based on this approach, it is possible to predict the folding behaviour of RNA molecules by numerical integration. Comparison with stochastic folding simulations shows reasonable agreement of the resulting folding dynamics and a drastic increase in computational efficiency that makes it possible to investigate the folding dynamics of RNA of at least tRNA size. Our approach is readily applicable to bistable RNA molecules and promises to facilitate studies on the dynamic behaviour of RNA switches.},

	Abstract = {We report a study of viscosity by the method of Helfand moment in systems with periodic boundary conditions. We propose a new definition of Helfand moment which takes into account the minimum image convention used in molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions. Our Helfand-moment method is equivalent to the method based on the Green-Kubo formula and is not affected by ambiguities due to the periodic boundary conditions. Moreover, in hard-ball systems, our method is equivalent to that developed by Alder, Gass, and Wainwright [J. Chem. Phys. 53, 3813 (1970)]. We apply and verify our method in a fluid composed of Ngreater than or equal to2 hard disks in elastic collisions. We show that the viscosity coefficients already take values in good agreement with Enskog's theory for N=2 hard disks in a hexagonal geometry.},

This technique has recently  been proposed for the efficient computation of biomolecular  conformations. One crucial step of UC is the decomposition of  reversible nearly uncoupled Markov chains into rapidly mixing  subchains. We show how the underlying scheme of uncoupling-coupling  can also be applied to stochastic differential equations where it  can be translated into a domain decomposition technique for partial  differential equations.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional vector fields undergoing a Hopf bifurcation are studied in a Liouville-equation approach, The Liouville equation rules the time evolution of statistical ensembles of trajectories issued from random initial conditions. but evolving under the deterministic dynamics. The time evolution of the probability densities of such statistical ensembles can be decomposed in terms of the spectrum of the resonances (i.e., the relaxation rates) of the Liouvillian operator or the related Frobenius-Perron operator. The spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian operator is explicitly constructed before, at, and after the Hopf bifurcation. Because of the emergence of time oscillations near the Hopf bifurcation, the resonance spectrum turns out to be complex and defined by both relaxation rates and oscillation frequencies. The resonance spectrum is discrete far from the bifurcation and becomes continuous at the bifurcation. This continuous spectrum is caused by the critical slowing down of the oscillations occurring at the Hopf bifurcation and it leads to power-law relaxation as 1/roott of the probability densities and statistical averages at long times t-->infinity. Moreover. degeneracy in the resonance spectrum is shown to yield a Jordan-block structure in the spectral decomposition.},

Here, we illustrate the practical importance of pfold and demonstrate how it can be determined theoretically. We derive a general analytical expression for pfold and show how it can be estimated from simulations for systems where the transition rates between the relevant microstates are not known. By analyzing the Ising model we are able to determine the scaling behavior of the numerical error in the pfold estimate as function of the number of analyzed Monte Carlo runs. We apply our method to a simple, newly developed protein folding model for the formation of alpha helices. It is demonstrated that our technique highly parallelizes the calculation of pfold and that it is orders of magnitude more efficient than conventional approaches.},

From this distribution function, fluctuation formulas associated with the constant volume specific heat C-upsilon, pressure coefficient gamma(upsilon), and isothermal compressibility beta(T) are obtained. The validity of the derived distribution function and the fluctuation formulas were examined in a Lennard-Jones fluid. C-upsilon and gamma(upsilon) calculated from the formulas for the WC thermostat agree very well with those obtained in the canonical or microcanonical MD. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

	Abstract = {We present a ``coarse molecular dynamics'' approach and apply it to studying the kinetics and thermodynamics of a peptide fragment dissolved in water. Short bursts of appropriately initialized simulations are used to infer the deterministic and stochastic components of the peptide motion parametrized by an appropriate set of coarse variables. Techniques from traditional numerical analysis (Newton-Raphson, coarse projective integration) are thus enabled; these techniques help analyze important features of the free-energy landscape (coarse transition states, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transition rates, etc.). Reverse integration of coarse variables backward in time can assist escape from free energy minima and trace low-dimensional free energy surfaces. To illustrate the coarse molecular dynamics approach, we combine multiple short (0.5 ps) replica simulations to map the free energy surface of the ``alanine dipeptide'' in water, and to determine the similar to1/(1000 ps) rate of interconversion between the two stable configurational basins corresponding to the alpha-helical and extended minima. },

	Abstract = {We present and discuss a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables models at a ``fine'' (microscopic/stochastic) level of description to perform modeling tasks at a ``coarse'' (macroscopic, systems) level. These macroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space scales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the microscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our equation-free (EF) approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann (LB), kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales,``coarse'' bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a systems identification based, ``closure on demand'' computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas through examples from chemical kinetics (LB, KMC), rheology (Brownian Dynamics), homogenization and the computation of ``coarsely self-similar'' solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the principles underlying the protein-folding problem can be tested by developing and characterizing simple models that make predictions which can be compared to experimental data. Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinelics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r = 0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r = 0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.},

@article{givon:unknown,
	Abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of macroscopic, or coarse-grained, quantities. A representative example is the prediction of biomolecular conformations from molecular dynamics. In recent years a number of new algorithmic approaches have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, models for the macroscopic dynamics; the starting point is the full, detailed, evolution equations. In many cases the effective low-dimensional dynamics may be stochastic, even when the original starting point is deterministic. This review surveys a number of these new approaches to the problem of extracting effective dynamics, highlighting similarities and differences between them. The importance of model problems for the evaluation of these new approaches is stressed, and a number of model problems are described. When the macroscopic dynamics is stochastic, these model problems are either obtained through a clear separation of time-scales, leading to a stochastic effect of the fast dynamics on the slow dynamics, or by considering high dimensional ordinary differential equations which, when projected onto a low dimensional subspace, exhibit stochastic behaviour through the presence of a broad frequency spectrum. Models whose stochastic microscopic behaviour leads to deterministic macroscopic dynamics are also introduced. The algorithms we overview include SVD-based methods for nonlinear problems, model reduction for linear control systems, optimal prediction techniques, asymptotics-based mode elimination, coarse timestepping methods and transfer-operator based methodologies. },

	Abstract = {We introduce a variational method for approximating distribution functions of dynamics with a ``Liouville operator'' L, in terms of a nonequilibrium action functional for two independent left and right trial states. The method is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics and for stationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical Rayleigh-Ritz procedure is advanced, whose inputs are a finitely parametrized Ansatz for the trial states, leading to a parametric action for their evolution. The Euler-Lagrange equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form generally noncanonical. This permits a simple identification of fixed points as critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a variational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and correlation functions, by means of the least effective action. The latter is a functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a consequence of Holder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the cost for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit it reduces to the Onsager-Machlup action. In general, the effective action is shown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained variation. This result provides a Rayleigh-Ritz scheme for calculating just the desired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding than for the full distribution.},

	Abstract = {We show that time-correlation functions of arbitrary order for any random variable in a statistical dynamical system can be calculated as higher-order response functions of the mean history of the variable. The response is to a ``control term'' added as a modification to the master equation for statistical distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational characterization of the generating functional of the time correlations. The same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment closures for the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the variational Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. For the two-time correlations of the moment variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to an ``Onsager regression hypothesis'' for the small fluctuations. For correlations of higher order, there is a further effect in addition to such linear propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the Ansatze required for an accurate calculation of the time correlations. We also comment briefly upon the computational use of these relations, which is well suited for automatic differentiation tools. An example will be given of a simple closure for turbulent energy decay, which illustrates the numerical application of the relations.

One method is based on Jarzynski's identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method [Darve and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples-internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski's identity is poor.},

The density, enthalpy of mixing, free enthalpy of urea hydration, and urea diffusion show very good agreement with the experimental values. The experimental error in the free enthalpy of hydration, which is dominated by the inaccuracy of the Vapor pressure of solid urea, is larger than the simulation error. This limited accuracy does not allow a check of the nonideality of the solution. Free enthalpies have been obtained by thermodynamic integration. The importance of a correct use of the combinatorial factor in the partition function when interpreting simulation results obtained by thermodynamic integration is discussed.

@article{lu:2004a,
	Abstract = {ntropy and enthalpy compensation are frequently observed in thermodynamic measurements. To understand the molecular details of these compensating changes, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods may, in principle, be used. Yet, in practice, computational methods to evaluate changes in entropy and enthalpy usually have much greater (e.g. order of magnitude worse) error than relative free energy calculations. In this paper, we examine ways to improve the computational ability to determine changes in both enthalpy and entropy. Toward that end we consider five different perturbation schemes for enthalpy determination and also consider the relative importance of staging the computation (i.e., dividing the entire perturbation calculation into a series of consecutive smaller ones) along the reaction coordinate. Two model systems are used for evaluation: a system of Lennard-Jones spheres, where the computation is directed to the addition/deletion of a sphere, and the alchemical transformation of an anion in explicit TIP3P water from one type to another. The results show only subtle differences among the better perturbation methods and much larger improvement in relative accuracy with the use and careful selection of staged intermediates along the reaction coordinate. As a result of these calculations, we suggest that approximate calculations of relative entropy be used to guide the staging of intermediates for computation of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy differences. We suggest that for these purposes the single state perturbation (SSP) method is the best choice. For the pure purpose of enthalpy and/or entropy evaluation, we suggest multistage SSP and direct approach, respectively, for systems with small and large differences.},

The process requires discretization of one or more reaction coordinates to generate a histogram from which the continuous probability density is inferred. We show that the finite size of the intervals used to construct the histogram leads to quantifiable systematic error. The width of these intervals also determines the statistical error in the free energy, and the choice of the appropriate interval is therefore driven by the need to balance the two sources of error. We present a method for the construction of the optimal histogram for a given system, and show that the use of this technique requires little additional computational expense. We demonstrate the efficacy of the technique for a model system, and discuss how the principles governing the choice of discretization interval could be used to improve extended sampling techniques.},

Two different reaction coordinates connecting the so-called C-5 and C-7 conformations, one involving intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the other involving the peptide phi,psi angles, are considered.


The Gibbs free energy differences Delta G(C-5 - C-7) are small in both cases, 1.5 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) and 2.2 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The two different reaction coordinates yield free energy differences that are identical to within their statistical error. It is found that the exchange of solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water hydrogen bonds involves free energy changes of less than k(B)T, which points at the existence of a multitude of low free energy pathways connecting the C-5 and C-7 dipeptide conformations.},

	Abstract = {To understand how a protein folds is a problem which has important biological implications. In this article, we would like to present a physics-oriented point of view, which is twofold. First of all, we introduce simple statistical mechanics models which display, in the thermodynamic limit, folding and related transitions. These models can be divided into (i) crude spin glass-like models (with their Mattis analogs), where one may look for possible correlations between the chain self-interactions and the folded structure, (ii) glass-like models, where one emphasizes the geometrical competition between one- or two-dimensional local order (mimicking alpha helix or beta sheet structures), and the requirement of global compactness. Both models are too simple to predict the spatial organization of a realistic protein, but are useful for the physicist and should have some feedback in other glassy systems (glasses, collapsed polymers,...). These remarks lead us to the second physical approach, namely a new Monte-Carlo method, where one grows the protein atom-by-atom (or residue-by-residue), using a standard form (CHARMM,...) for the total energy. A detailed comparison with other Monte-Carlo schemes, or Molecular Dynamics calculations, is then possible; we will sketch such a comparison for poly-alanines. Our twofold approach illustrates some of the difficulties one encounters in the protein folding problem, in particular those associated with the existence of a large number of metastable states.

	Abstract = {Recently, a novel concept for the computation of essential features of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems (such as molecular dynamics) has been proposed. The realization of this concept had been based on subdivision techniques applied to the Frobenius-Perron operator for the dynamical system. The present paper suggests an alternative but related concept that merges the conceptual advantages of the dynamical systems approach with the appropriate statistical physics framework. This approach allows us to define the phrase ``conformation'' in terms of the dynamical behavior of the molecular system and to characterize the dynamical stability of conformations. In a first step, the frequency of conformational changes is characterized in statistical terms leading to the definition of some Markov operator T that describes the corresponding transition probabilities within the canonical ensemble. In a second step, a discretization of T via specific hybrid Monte Carlo techniques is shown to lead to a stochastic matrix P. With these theoretical preparaions, an identification algorithm for conformations (to be presented in a later paper) is applicable. It is demonstrated that the discretization of T can be restricted to few essential degrees of freedom so that the combinatorial explosion of discretization boxes is prevented and biomolecular systems can be attacked. Numerical results for the n-pentane molecule and the triribonucleotide adenylyl(3'-5')cytidylyl(3'-5')cytidin are given and interpreted. },

	Abstract = {''Statistical potentials'' are energies widely used in computer algorithms to fold, dock, or recognize protein structures. They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of these assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities. },

Most of the former work on this subject treated the direct problem: given the aggregates, analyze the loose coupling in connection with the computation of the stationary distribution (aggregation/disaggregation techniques). In contrast to that, the present paper focuses on the inverse problem: given the system as a whole, identify the almost invariant aggregates together with the (small) probabilities of transitions between them. A robust algorithm is worked out on the basis of some detailed perturbation analysis and illustrated at a simple molecular system.},

Within this perspective ensembles of trajectories  can be sampled and manipulated in close analogy to standard techniques  of statistical mechanics.

UCMC aims at avoiding the typical metastable or trapping behavior of Monte Carlo techniques. From the viewpoint of Monte Carlo, a slowly converging long-time Markov chain is replaced by a limited number of rapidly mixing short-time ones. Therefore, the state space of the chain has to be hierarchically decomposed into its metastable conformations. This is done by means of combining the technique of conformation analysis as recently introduced by the authors, and appropriate annealing strategies. We present a detailed examination of the uncoupling-coupling procedure which uncovers its theoretical background, and illustrates the hierarchical algorithmic approach. Furthermore, application of the UCMC algorithm to the n-pentane molecule allows us to discuss the effect of its crucial steps in a typical molecular scenario.},

	Abstract = {We have used distributed computing techniques and a supercluster of thousands of computer processors to study folding of the C-terminal beta -hairpin from protein G in atomistic detail using the GB/SA implicit solvent model at 300 K. We have simulated a total of nearly 38 mus of, folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories. Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an unfolded state characterized by non-specific, temporary hydrogen bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same time that the final hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core and proper beta -sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the existing experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which define a thermodynamic trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with a single rate-limiting step in which a varying final hydrogen bond pattern is apparent, and senmi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear early in the folding process. We include details of the ensemble dynamics methodology and a discussion of our achievements using this new computational device for studying dynamics at the atomic level.},

A method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath.},

	Abstract = {In this work we demonstrate the use of a rigorous formalism for the extraction of state-to-state transition functions as a way to study the kinetics of protein folding in the context of a Markov chain. The approach is illustrated by its application to two different systems: a blocked alanine dipeptide in a vacuum and the C-terminal beta-hairpin motif from protein G in water. The first system displays some of the desired features of the approach, whereas the second illustrates some of the challenges that must be overcome to apply the method to more complex biomolecular systems. For both example systems, Boltzmann weighted conformations produced by a replica exchange Monte Carlo procedure were used as starting states for kinetic trajectories. The alanine dipeptide displays Markovian behavior in a state space defined with respect to phi-psi torsion angles. In contrast, Markovian behavior was not observed for the beta-hairpin in a state space where all possible native hydrogen bonding patterns were resolved. This may be due to our choice of state definitions or sampling limitations. Furthermore, the use of different criteria for hydrogen bonding results in the apparent observation of different mechanisms from the same underlying data: one set of criteria indicate a zipping type of process, but another indicates more of a collapse followed by almost simultaneous formation of a large number of contacts. Analysis of long-lived states observed during the simulations of the beta-hairpin suggests that important aspects of the folding process that are not captured by order parameters in common use include the formation of non-native hydrogen bonds and the degree and nature of salt bridge formation.},

Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},
